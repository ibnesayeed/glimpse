"Spotlight kitties of day.... Hope and Joy!! Hope and Joy are in need of an extra special home or homes. They are beautiful, sweet and very loving girls. Hope is a 2 year old spayed female, she is the mama of Joy, who is a 6 month old spayed female. Joy and her 3 litter-mates were rescued in June, their rescuer fostered them for OFCP. When they went in to get spayed/neutered, vaccinated and tested at 3 months old, all 4 kittens tested positive for FeLV. In most rescues this is a death sentence, we asked that they be retested in 60 days, as they were right at the boarder line for still carrying it from their mom, if she had it. The colony caregiver/foster knew who their mom was, she was also living outside his home. He caught her so we could test her.... sure enough she tested positive for FeLV as well. The foster was unable to take the cats back, so we put them into isolation to wait out the 60 days, hoping and praying that we would have a different outcome in 2 months. In the meantime, I started contacting FeLV Sanctuary’s, all over the US, (I’m sure you long time followers remember Jasmine, she was accepted at The Blind Cat Sanctuary in North Carolina several years ago, she now lives happily in a cage free room with other FeLV kitties). We thankfully had a couple sanctuary’s say they could help us out.... if the tests came back positive. But we were all holding out hope they would come back negative. We waiting patiently for the results.... they finally cane back and they were all FIVE negative for FeLV!!! We were ecstatic and so thankful this amazing family would get a chance of loving families and hone. A few weeks later on the the kittens suddenly got very sick, she was rushed to the vet, she kept declining, she ended up dying of FIP, unfortunately 2 more of the kittens ended up dying from the same disease. We have been absolutely devastated, these kitties were cheated, they didn’t end up having FeLV, but that damned FIP stole their lives from them. FIP is a horrible disease with no vaccination or cure currently in the US, other country’s are currently working on a cure and getting great results, but it’s not here yet and is extremely expensive. We’ve had extensive testing done on Hope and Joy, to see if they are prone to the same fate. They are both positive for the coronavirus, which can lead to FIP. Many cats can live long happy lives with the coronavirus. They are both in need of a stress free home where they can be the only kitty or a home together or with other coronavirus cats. Hope and Joy have been through so much, they may have a shortened life, but hopefully they can live a long and happy life. We don’t want these girls living their life in a cage. They deserve so much more. Please share their story, so we can hopefully find them a loving home or homes. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioFeralCatProject/photos/a.197490901792/10156420810056793/?type=3","Ontario Feral Cat Project",2019-12-02 14:00:31

"Joan E. Bauer: China Journal, 1997 In steam-baked Wuhan, land of fish and lakes, near the cross-banks of Yangtze and Han, we walk into Mao’s sanctum, the grand hall of hand-cut rock. A bamboo raft in Guilin. We drift at dusk with fishermen, their bonded cormorants. It’s quiet, but for the raucous cry of birds, the splash of wings. Circling their necks, a ring of hemp. The muscular pilot, cigarette in hand, pulls the scraggly birds from silt-brown water, tossing them every seventh fish. Do cormorants accept the bondage? And as they ease to sleep, what flickers in their dreams: mud-skinned master open sky cooling wave eye of silver fish?

"How do world's smallest sea turtles become stranded in Cape Cod? - ScienceBlog.com A computational analysis has surfaced new insights into the wind and water conditions that cause Kemp's ridley sea turtles to become stranded on beaches A computational analysis has surfaced new insights into the wind and water conditions that cause Kemp's ridley sea turtles to become stranded on beaches in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Xiaojian Liu of Wuhan University, China, and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on December 4, 2019. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle is smaller and in greater danger of extinction than any other sea turtle in the world.
